<h3>How Web pages Work</h3>
<p>A user accesses a website by typing in a url, sending this information to a server via the Internet using <em>HTTP</em>.  The server replies back with the data to display to the user and the browser interprets this <em>HTTP</em> reply and displays this information in the browser.

  is a good video to explain this.

<b>HTML</b>
<p>HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
  content on the web, HTML documents contain <em>Text</em>, <em> markups</em>, images, videos, links. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see"
  and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks".

  video</a> shows this.
</p>

<b>Tags and Elements</b>
<p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. Elements are what is shown between different <b>tags</b>. There are also <b>attributes</b> which help give the property of the html tag like an image or link location.
  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">This video</a>
  explains the distinction well.

<b>Why Computers are Stupid</b>
<p>Computers are stupid because they only understand one language and if you forget a tab closer or you mistype something, it doesnt pretend to know what you mean.  The programmer who works with them has to be smart and know what the computer is looking for at all times to display what they want to display
</p>

<b>Inline vs Block Elements</b>
<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
  elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of
  them. Block tag: will block off exactly the formatting in HTML and translate that exactly to the page in that block. Inline tags can write text all on same line with diff formatting to happen on webpage.
